Blackjack Assessment (BBC)

Welcome to my blackjack Project! I hope you have as much fun playing with it as I did making it. Enjoy! 



Game/Project Assumptions

Card Values:

Ace = 11 or 1
King = 10
Queen = 10
Joker = 10
9 of any suit = 9
8 of any suit = 8
7 of any suit = 7
6 of any suit = 6
5 of any suit = 5
4 of any suit = 4
3 of any suit = 3
2 of any suit = 2

1) If a player draws an ace while his current hand total is equal to 11 or greater, they will choose for their Ace card to be of value 1

2) There is only one dealer and one player

3) The dealer cannot "Hit" or "Stay". One the player is capable of this

4) The player can "Hit" or "Stay" as many times as they would like

5) Once you have decided the value of your Ace card you cannot change it

6) If both the Dealer and The Player hit 21 the game ends in a draw
